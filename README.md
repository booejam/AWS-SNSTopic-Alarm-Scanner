A lightweight Python script that scans your AWS environment to identify which CloudWatch Alarms are configured to trigger a specific SNS (Simple Notification Service) topic.

**DESCRIPTION**

`sns-alarm-scanner` is an automation tool that helps monitor the connection between CloudWatch alarms and SNS topics. It eliminates the need for manual inspection by programmatically scanning all CloudWatch alarms and checking which ones are linked to a given SNS topic.
